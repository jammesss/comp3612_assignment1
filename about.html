<!-- Our Story -->
    <section class="story">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            COMP3612 Assign 1 began with a simple belief: that every programmer deserves clothes that not only 
            look exceptional but feel extraordinary. Founded in 2025 by Your Name, our company emerged from a 
            shared frustration with the compromise between quality and affordability in the coding attire market, 
            as well as a strong desire to get an A grade in COMP3612.
